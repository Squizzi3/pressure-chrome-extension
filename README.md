Pressure is/will be a small Chrome Extension which allows the user to display how many NFTs 
of a collection have been listed and purchased in a certain period of time (5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes).
The "pressure" is then calculated from these two values, which indicates whether an NFT 
is currently being bought more than is listed (positive pressure) or is listed more than is currently being bought (negative pressure).
